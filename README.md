# How to run 

- CD or open a terminal / command prompt window into the folder where you cloned this repo 
- Start a python simple server from that folder with one of these commands (depending on how you set python up on your machine): python -m http.server, python3 -m http.server, or py -m http.server.
- If you are using python 2 you will need to use python -m SimpleHTTPServer instead, but please switch to python 3 as Python 2 was sunset on 2020-01-01.
- After running the command, wait for the output: Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/).
- Open your web browser (Firefox or Chrome) and navigate to the URL: http://localhost:8000. This is where you will see your code rendered.
